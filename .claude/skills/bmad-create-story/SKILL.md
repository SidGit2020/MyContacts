# Create Story Workflow

**Goal:** Create a comprehensive story file that gives the dev agent everything needed for flawless implementation.

**Your Role:** Story context engine that prevents LLM developer mistakes, omissions, or disasters.
- Communicate all responses in {communication_language} and generate all documents in {document_output_language}
- Your purpose is NOT to copy from epics - it's to create a comprehensive, optimized story file that gives the DEV agent EVERYTHING needed for flawless implementation
- COMMON LLM MISTAKES TO PREVENT: reinventing wheels, wrong libraries, wrong file locations, breaking regressions, ignoring UX, vague implementations, lying about completion, not learning from past work
- EXHAUSTIVE ANALYSIS REQUIRED: You must thoroughly analyze ALL artifacts to extract critical context - do NOT be lazy or skim! This is the most important function in the entire development process!
- UTILIZE SUBPROCESSES AND SUBAGENTS: Use research subagents, subprocesses or parallel processing if available to thoroughly analyze different artifacts simultaneously and thoroughly
- SAVE QUESTIONS: If you think of questions or clarifications during analysis, save them for the end after the complete story is written
- ZERO USER INTERVENTION: Process should be fully automated except for initial epic/story selection or missing documents

Subagents, when the capability is available, are an important part of this workflow. Use them as directed by the workflow steps.
If you need an explicit user instruction to run them, ask once now for the whole workflow run.

## Conventions

- Bare paths (e.g. `discover-inputs.md`) resolve from the skill root.
- `{skill-root}` resolves to this skill's installed directory (where `customize.toml` lives).
- `{project-root}`-prefixed paths resolve from the project working directory.
- `{skill-name}` resolves to the skill directory's basename.

## On Activation

### Step 1: Resolve the Workflow Block

Run: `python3 {project-root}/_bmad/scripts/resolve_customization.py --skill {skill-root} --key workflow`

**If the script fails**, resolve the `workflow` block yourself by reading these three files in base → team → user order and applying the same structural merge rules as the resolver:

1. `{skill-root}/customize.toml` — defaults
2. `{project-root}/_bmad/custom/{skill-name}.toml` — team overrides
3. `{project-root}/_bmad/custom/{skill-name}.user.toml` — personal overrides

Any missing file is skipped. Scalars override, tables deep-merge, arrays of tables keyed by `code` or `id` replace matching entries and append new entries, and all other arrays append.

### Step 2: Execute Prepend Steps

Execute each entry in `{workflow.activation_steps_prepend}` in order before proceeding.

### Step 3: Load Persistent Facts

Treat every entry in `{workflow.persistent_facts}` as foundational context you carry for the rest of the workflow run. Entries prefixed `file:` are paths or globs under `{project-root}` — load the referenced contents as facts. All other entries are facts verbatim.

### Step 4: Load Config

Load config from `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/config.yaml` and resolve:

- `project_name`, `user_name`
- `communication_language`, `document_output_language`
- `user_skill_level`
- `planning_artifacts`, `implementation_artifacts`
- `date` as system-generated current datetime

### Step 5: Greet the User

Greet `{user_name}`, speaking in `{communication_language}`.

### Step 6: Execute Append Steps

Execute each entry in `{workflow.activation_steps_append}` in order.

Activation is complete. If `activation_steps_prepend` or `activation_steps_append` were non-empty, confirm every entry was executed in order before proceeding. Do not begin the main workflow until all activation steps have been completed.

## Paths

- `sprint_status` = `{implementation_artifacts}/sprint-status.yaml`
- `epics_file` = `{planning_artifacts}/epics.md`
- `prd_file` = `{planning_artifacts}/prd.md`
- `architecture_file` = `{planning_artifacts}/architecture.md`
- `ux_file` = `{planning_artifacts}/*ux*.md`
- `story_title` = "" (will be elicited if not derivable)
- `default_output_file` = `{implementation_artifacts}/{{story_key}}.md`

## Input Files

| Input | Description | Path Pattern(s) | Load Strategy |
|-------|-------------|------------------|---------------|
| prd | PRD — section-indexed only; epics holds synthesized content; specific PRD sections cited in story | whole: `{planning_artifacts}/*prd*.md`, sharded: `{planning_artifacts}/*prd*/*.md` | SECTION_INDEX |
| architecture | Architecture — section-indexed only; specific sections cited in story for dev agent | whole: `{planning_artifacts}/*architecture*.md`, sharded: `{planning_artifacts}/*architecture*/*.md` | SECTION_INDEX |
| ux | UX design — section-indexed only; specific sections cited in story for dev agent | whole: `{planning_artifacts}/*ux*.md`, sharded: `{planning_artifacts}/*ux*/*.md` | SECTION_INDEX |
| epics | Enhanced epics+stories file with BDD and source hints — PRIMARY source, must be fully loaded | whole: `{planning_artifacts}/*epic*.md`, sharded: `{planning_artifacts}/*epic*/*.md` | SELECTIVE_LOAD |
| domain_research | Domain research — section-indexed only; relevant technical sections cited in story | `{planning_artifacts}/research/*domain*.md` | SECTION_INDEX |
| market_research | Market research — section-indexed only; relevant sections cited in story | `{planning_artifacts}/research/*market*.md` | SECTION_INDEX |
